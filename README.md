# Zé Pedro Resende

## Hi there

I'm a fullstack developer with a passion for code, clean code.

I just love when "code reads like prose" and that's why I'm investing so much time on Software Architecture and Clean Code. I'm currently conceptualizing PDD (Package Driven Development) which is a superset of FDD (Feature Driven Development).

I am also finishing my degree in IT at Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.

The stack that I use is all about JavaScript, so I'm all about mastering TypeScript and use it in React, React Native and backend development with NodeJS to create amazing web applications. I'm also really interested in system architecture being microservices and containers with Docker and Kubernetes.

As a sports enthusiast I'm extremely competitive and perfectionist. Inspired by Kobe Bryant, the Mamba Mentality is in everything that I do and mark my words: I will be the best developer that I can be.

I created a project called Synxty where I plan to talk about mental health, clean code, good software architecture and design and to provide tools to help people starting the developer journey the right way and also help current developers to get better, so we are all in sync.
